* Move generation:
- many functions arguments are not marked as strict anymore (but it's not clear if this has some influence on performance)
- non capturing direct checking moves are now generated in queen to knight order (not sure if this has some impact on speed or nodes)
- history & sorting of non capturing moves take the distance to the root as a parameter (depth influence of a move is only local)
* Search:
- some search parameter adjusted (less extensions, less check evasions in quiescence search)
- beeing forced in endless check is not evaluated to 0, but to a (small) negative value (parameter)
- distance to the root is kept in search status (and used in some places, like move generation)
- delta margin is now a parameter (not a method)
* Other:
- evaluation parameter configuration file has nicer syntax now (var = value, one per line)
- bug corrected when best move was a promotion: now the promoted piece is added
- log level defaults to 0 (no log)
