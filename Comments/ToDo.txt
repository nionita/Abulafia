Todo list for Abulafia:
=======================

For 0.62:
=========
+ lmrMinDFRes not used anymore
+ Separate again in PV search and scout
+ timeNodes: raise on (4096-1) ~ every 80 ms
+ In alphaBeta: when beta cut (aspiration): set cut move ahead the root move list for research (+ pvcont!)
+ Same for failed low: new pvcont is longer
+ In pv…Exten: tact and inPv are not necessary when no lmr, simplify and optimize the conditions (order)
- How does the history look? Tool to see some probes
- For exception (error) in search thread: restart (with old status as start)
- Collect error positions and analyse
+ forpv has no meaning when a=b-1! Can we get it out? Could be a RON?
- scoreGrain should be in a common constants module
- What is the correct maximal depth extension (maxDepthExt)? 2 or 3?
- LMR Parameter not ok (13 and 8: almost nothing is reduced!)
- Futility Parameter should be optimised (some statistic?) Shouldn't they be dependent on game phase?
- Experiment with futility: increasing margins with the draft
+ Clean older comments
- Root moves order: is this enough? Exact scores should be considered where available
- In checkFailOrPVRoot and checkFailOrPVLoop: missing a nextNodeType in case s<=a?
- Better Name for Search monad
- (-a-1) and (-a) could be computed only once...
- At the end: some stricts (!) are perhaps not necessary
- For further speed optimisation: Changes which shape the tree different cannot be compared against each other!

Tried in 0.62, but no better results:
=====================================
- Read-only values (RO):
        - on tree level (ROT): all from PVReadonly (albest, timeli, abmili) + draft
        - on node level (RON): (from PVState:) absdp, usedext, ownnt (must be always initialised before a deeper search)
- Variable values (RW):
        - on tree level (RWT): abort, short, stats
        - on node level (RWN): all of NodeState except ownnt
- Make search monad a direct reader/state monad (new reader parameter + ask and asks)
