* Search:
- improved beta margin for null move search implemented, but values seems not to be well choosen
- provisions for expected node type - not finalized
- some simplifications in the interface of the search module
- re-search after fail of the null window search is now possible (parametrised)
- when learnig eval parameters, the current node is qsearched
* Other:
- separation of the context and game impelemntation, so that now other (simpler) contexts as CtxIO is possible, for example for self play and other learning utilities
- reorganization of the files and directories, some cleanup of old files
- transposition table (hash) a bit simplified, nodes are now stored exactly
- there is no priority and generation in the transposition table anymore (they were not used anyway)
- eval learning has variable learning rate (it still does not brings much when leaning!)
- limits for eval parameters are smaller now (only important when learning)
- when learning, logging is forced
- eval config file can be give as argument
- for cuts also a history subtract can be made, when the move is expected to cut, it it doesn't (parameter)
- history depth influence is parametrised
- two programs to adjust the parameters offline according to some error minimum - e(d-1) - e(d)
