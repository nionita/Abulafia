Changes for 0.40:
- Move is coded as a 32 bit word
- move generation is pseudo legal
- no pinned pieces management anymore
- SEE changes: swap algorithm (but further used only for QS)
- Search: the PV path is used as first move down in every PV node, as long available
- Config: protected window on 30000 (don't know if it's better!)
