* Move generation:
- non capturing check giving moves are generated and used for quiescent search
- use of routines for capture generations is parametrised for easier tests
- SEE functions adjusted to seem to be more correct, but still not tested
- SEE simplified for hanging pieces
- SEE approximated for easy captures (always winning) and parametrised
* Evaluation:
- new eval items were added: for available castels, for figures on last line (except king and rooks) and for opponent king mobility when this is alone (so that simple mates should be more probable)
- the parameter learning algorythm uses a variable adjustment step based on the angle of the last to deviations seen
- when evaluating, the score is not scaled by material anymore (material is 1)
- when learning, the material score will not be changed (limits = 1)
* Search:
- for root moves, the after depth 1 search the moves are sorted by score and not by nodes (which were always 1)
* Other:
- nodes storing in transposition table is parametrised (units can be a power of 2) and by reading approximated
