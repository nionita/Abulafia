Changes for 0.55:
=================
* Evaluation:
- material values changed
- king safety is now based only on attacs, not also on defences anymore (but it is still primitive)
- king mobility is not calculated anymore
- bishop pair and rook redundance are considered
- rook pawn penalty considered
- the score granulation is parametric (should be 0,2,4 or 8)
- speed optimisations due to strictness (not yet definitive)
* Move generation:
- speed optimisations due to strictness (can be more done?)
- preparations for smart SEE with attacks/attacked (POI) - not yet integrated
* Search:
- speed optimisations due to strictness - I even don't know if it's good enough
* Other:
- when give a parameter file, the engine displays the file name as part of the id
