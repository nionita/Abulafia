Changes for 0.56
================
Evaluation:
- interior node recognition is implemented for some known finals (KmK, KNNK, KBNK, KBBK, KMxK) - not everything is tested
- passed pawns are recognised and evaluated (no pawn hash yet)
- king central position is evaluated (malus when there are major pieces more than a rook, bonus when less)
Other:
- the code was passed through hlint and most of errors/warnings were fixed
