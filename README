This is an UCI chess engine written in Haskell.

Currently it is very weak (compared to other engines; but for a human opponent it could be
still interesting! I can't beat it, and I'm about 1800 Elo).

It has one big known bug - it does not handle en-passant captures. This will be corrected
soon. Also for short time controls sometimes is losing by time.

In order to build it you will need the Haskell Platform (at least 2011.2) as well as some
Hackage packages (see Abulafia.cabal). Both Windows and Linux platforms possible (probably also Mac, but I did not test it).

In order to use it, you will need a UCI GUI. You can use Arena (www.playwitharena.com)
or WinBoard/XBoard.
